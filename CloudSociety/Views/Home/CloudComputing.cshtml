                                                    company. Using SaaS, the vendor often grants access to the application to its customers

                                                    Thanks to the Information Technology Act 2000. Days are gone when people would worry
                                                    about the veracity of electronic documents. Today, digital signatures are the norm
                                                    and are used by nearly every top organization be it banks, industries, or businesses.
                                                    Computer-generated documents don't need signatures anymore, which means they can
                                                    safely be emailed, stored for record keeping, and even produced as legal proof.

                                                    In the face of such advantages, we as a society and a nation should strive towards
                                                    reducing the burden we have placed on our trees, forests and ultimately on green
                                                    environment. Our solution software-as-a-service application is a first step for

                                                    a relationship of harmony with our nature than that of conflict.<br />
